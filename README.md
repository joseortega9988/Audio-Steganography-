## Porpuse of the script

A company has commissioned me to develop a Python script demonstrating steganography, the practice of hiding secret messages within non-secret media, in this case, audio files. The specific technique used here involves modifying the least significant bits of an audio file's data to encode a message without significantly altering the audio's perceptible properties.
